Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assignment
=========================================
## Introduction
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. The purpose of this project is to analyze data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The data is available [here (zip file)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). A full description [is available](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) at the site where the data was obtained.
## Requirements
This project does not require any additional packages. It has been tested with R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25), platform i386-w64-mingw32/i386 (32-bit).
## Scripts
There is one script: __run_analysis.R__. Download the script from this repo and use it to analyze the dataset.
## Dataset
[Download the dataset (zip file)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)  and extract it into a folder named "__dataset__". 
## Analysis
__run_analysis.R__ and the "__dataset__" folder have to be stored in the same main directory. Set this main directory as "__working directory__" in R Gui / RStudio and source run_analysis.R.
